# Background

This is the Tableland Rigs contract and client components.

# Development

Get started with installing and building the project:

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npm run build
```

## Extacting the ABI and Bytecode

Can you grab the assets you need by compiling and then using some `jq` magic:

### ABI

```shell
cat artifacts/contracts/TablelandRigs.sol/TablelandRigs.json | jq '.abi' > abi.json
```

### Bytecode

```shell
cat artifacts/contracts/TablelandRigs.sol/TablelandRigs.json | jq -r '.bytecode' > bytecode.bin
```

### Generate the Go client!

You can use the above `abi.json` to build the Go client:

```shell
mkdir gobuild
abigen --abi ./abi.json --bin ./bytecode.bin --pkg contracts --out gobuild/TablelandRigs.go
```

## Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Rinkeby.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Rinkeby node URL (e.g., from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid `.env` file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/deploy.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

## Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).
